The M/M/s queueing model, similar to the M/M/1 model, is a queuing system used in operations research and queuing theory. The notation M/M/s represents the characteristics of the model:
M: Stands for memoryless arrivals. Arrival times of customers follow an exponential probability distribution, implying that arrivals occur independently and at a constant rate.
M: Also stands for memoryless service times. The service times for each customer follow an exponential probability distribution, indicating that service times are independent and at a constant rate.
s: Represents the number of servers in the system.
